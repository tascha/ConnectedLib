<table class="heading-cell no-common-style"><tr><th colspan="2">POTENTIAL PARTNER NAME</th></tr><tr><th>UNFAMILIAR AUDIENCES</th><td>If the organization is bringing a new set of patrons into your library, make sure your staff are prepared and equipped to serve them appropriately. This is particularly important if the teens have special abilities or needs, or are in a vulnerable situation. Professional development and training can help staff gain the skills and understanding they need to serve an unfamiliar group of patrons.</td></tr><tr><th>VULNERABLE TEENS</th><td>Organizations that work with vulnerable teens may have policies in place to protect them and their privacy, and you may need to adjust your programs or procedures accordingly. Discuss this with your partner during the planning stage so you won’t be surprised by a policy mid-project.</td></tr><tr><th>TURNOVER</th><td>Organizations that work with teens in particularly difficult situations may have a turnover rate that is higher than normal. To avoid “starting over” with each new employee, try to get more than one person at the other organization invested and involved in your partnership.</td></tr></table>
