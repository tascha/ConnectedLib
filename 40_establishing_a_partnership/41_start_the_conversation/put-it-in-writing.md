### PUT IT IN WRITING {#put-it-in-writing}

Depending on the size and formality of your project, a written agreement, **contract**, or **memorandum of understanding** may be useful or even required.<sup>[40]</sup>,<sup>[41]</sup>. Contracts are legally binding and are particularly important in situations that involve money, intellectual property, or other resources of value; a memorandum of understanding is not legally binding, but is useful for clarifying and recording agreements.<sup>[42]</sup>.

<div class="table-format1"><span class="title"><h5>WHAT GOES INTO A MOU? </h5></span><p>Each memorandum of understanding, or MOU, may be a little different, depending on the organizations involved and the nature of the project, but here are some questions that they should usually answer: </p><ul>❏ Why is the MOU being created? <br>❏ What organizations are involved in the project? What are their roles? Be as specific as possible, and include administrative tasks like schedule meetings and following-up with people about deadlines. <br>❏	What activities are involved in the project? What is the timeline for these activities and the partnership as a whole? <br>❏ How will you communicate during the partnership? 
 <br>❏ What is the project, and why are your organizations involved? 
 <br>❏	Who will train staff, if needed?<br>❏	Who will be responsible for maintaining the project or program and any related materials? <br>❏	If changes are needed mid-way through the collaboration, who will decide what changes to make, and when? <br>❏	How will you evaluate the program’s success? What will you measure, and who will do collect that information? Who will receive a copy of the final evaluation report?</ul></div>
