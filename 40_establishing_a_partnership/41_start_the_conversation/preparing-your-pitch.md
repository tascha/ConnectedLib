### PREPARING YOUR PITCH {#preparing-your-pitch}

A community partnership should benefit all stakeholders — the library, the partner, and the community. When proposing a collaboration, it’s important to understand and articulate how the project will benefit each of these. Developing an “elevator speech” for your library or specifically for your youth services department will help you when you approach potential partners.<sup><sup id="281255367986520-footnote-ref-36"><a href="#281255367986520-footnote-36">[37]</a></sup></sup> Elevator speeches or pitches are “brief opportunities—maybe one minute or less—to pique the interest of anyone whose ear you’d like to bend about libraries.”<sup><sup id="281255367986520-footnote-ref-37"><a href="#281255367986520-footnote-37">[38]</a></sup></sup> The elevator speech should be specific to your library, and maybe even a single branch, and should highlight the unique contributions the library can bring to the partnership and the impact it can have on youth. Although you may need to tailor the pitch for each potential partner, crafting a flexible, reusable template will save time when you set up future partnerships.

**BUILDING A RELATIONSHIP**

<div class="text">“It was just a get-to-know-you lunch. Yet, unbeknownst to us, as we sipped soup and ordered sandwiches, we were laying the groundwork for a long, fruitful partnership.” -- Kathleen Baxter and Susan M. Haggberg<sup>[39]</sup>
</div>


You can start building relationships with other organizations without a concrete or even a vague goal in mind. Networking with people who have a different perspective on the youth in your community is valuable in and of itself. It’s also a good idea to have an idea of what other organizations are doing for youth, so you don’t duplicate efforts. Informal relationships are often the catalyst for creative partnership ideas born out of simply chatting with each other about your work.

**WHAT IF THEY SAY NO?**

<div class="text">“People are afraid of the "no", and that's truly the worst that can happen. I have been shut down so many times I'm like, ‘Alright, well, there's five more ice cream shops on this block, so I'll find something.’” -- MLAFocusGroup</div>

No matter how persuasive and well-crafted your pitch is, you may be turned down. Don’t take it personally. Turn it into a learning experience by understanding why the potential partner wasn’t on board. Did you start the conversation with a fully formed concept, without letting them share their input and expertise? Accept critical feedback with grace and an open mind, then determine if it is worth adjusting your approach moving forward. Perhaps you can even re-approach the same partner in the future.


<div class="table-format1"><span class="title"><h5>QUESTIONS TO ASK YOUR PARTNER BEFORE MAKING PLANS</h5></span><p>You should adapt this list for each partner, but here are some questions to start with to help you understand your partner’s needs and situations. </p><ul>❏ How many people do you work with in a typical day (or week, or month)? How many teens? <br>❏ Reach out to someone at the PTA. You can reach out to parent-teacher associations as well. They may be planning events the library can participate in, or have other ideas about how the library and the school can work together. And crucially, they may have more spare time than school employees.
<br>❏ Develop a way to stay in touch with teachers. Keeping teachers abreast of the latest library resources and programs for youth through a newsletter or e-mail can help remind them to stay in touch with you about upcoming lessons and assignments.
<br>❏  Start small. Working together on a one-time event can benefit both school and public library, and requires less time commitment than an ongoing partnership.<sup>[29]</sup> (Cooksey, 2017).<br>❏	Be in it for the long haul. If a partnership with the school just doesn’t materialize, consider building that relationship anyway by simply helping out—you could assist with an event, volunteer to help in the library, or support advocacy efforts for the school and the school library.<sup>[30]</sup> This will help you learn more about the school and its needs, and may end up blossoming into a real partnership down the line.
</ul>
