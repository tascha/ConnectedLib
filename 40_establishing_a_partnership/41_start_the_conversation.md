## 4.1 Start the conversation {#4-1-start-the-conversation}

When you first approach your partner, you can bring a partnership idea to the table, but be flexible — you may not know all their needs and capabilities at first. If possible, get a feel for how they work, what they&#039;re doing, and what their needs are by attending community meetings or events they hold.<sup>[31]</sup> Make sure you can speak to how the library’s vision is complementary to your potential partner’s mission.<sup>[32]</sup>

Don’t underestimate the value of starting small, with informal conversations, a small pilot program or a trial collaboration.<sup>[33]</sup>,<sup>[34]</sup> Starting off with a small or one-off collaboration can be a great way to test the waters of a partnership. Whereas a formal partnership with a larger organization may require paperwork and managerial support, smaller efforts are easier, less time-consuming, and can be evidence in support of a more extensive partnership if they go well.<sup>[35]</sup> One way to start small is by finding community events that are already in the planning stages, and offering support or involvement from the library.<sup>[36]</sup>
