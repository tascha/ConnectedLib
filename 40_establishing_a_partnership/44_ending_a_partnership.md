## 4.4 Ending a Partnership {#4-4-ending-a-partnership}

### Wrapping up

It’s tempting to move on to the next project once a collaboration has concluded, but taking the time to properly wrap-up will benefit both you and your partner. Collect any numbers, stories or artifacts that will help tell the story of your program. Have a debriefing meeting with everyone involved to discuss what went well and what could be improved. Make sure you thank the people you worked with directly, as well as any managers or administrators whose approval or cooperation was required.

### Evaluation

If you and your partner agreed on an evaluation plan at the beginning of the project, evaluating your collaborative effort should be easy. Share the results of your program evaluation with your partner at the end of the project so they know what kind of impact they had. Take those numbers and stories you gathered and communicate them to relevant stakeholders to illustrate the impact of your program. See the Assessments and Outcomes module for more.

### Laying the groundwork for the next collaboration

If your initial collaboration was successful, both you and your partner will be enthusiastic about working together in the future. If you don’t have any additional work together planned, let your partner know you’ll be happy to collaborate again. Keeping partners up-to-date with your programs and offerings will help remind them of what the library can offer, and they may approach you with their own ideas for collaborations.
