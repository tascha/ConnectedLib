## 3.1 Discover Your Community’s Assets {#3-1-discover-your-community-s-assets}

**_If we want to help people in a way that does no harm to them and their capacities and their communities, then the best place to start is with what is strong within them and within their communities, not with what’s wrong. - Cormac Russell<sup><sup id="281255367986520-footnote-ref-47"><a href="#281255367986520-footnote-47">[48]</a></sup></sup>_**

For an in-depth look at community asset mapping, see the Community Mapping module. This section will provide a brief overview of the asset-based community development model that is covered in more detail in the other module.

The **asset-based** **model** community development focuses on the strengths of a community, rather than its weaknesses. Broadly speaking, community asset-mapping is a way to take stock of “the gifts, skills and capacities of individuals, voluntary associations, institutions, physical assets, local economy assets and stories in the community.”<sup><sup id="281255367986520-footnote-ref-48"><a href="#281255367986520-footnote-48">[49]</a></sup></sup> Depending on the size of your library and the resources you have to work with, this could be an extensive process involving focus groups and interviews, or just a few hours brainstorming and researching by yourself.

| In [**this TEDx talk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5xR4QB1ADw&feature=youtu.be), Cormac Russell explains why it’s important to focus on the strengths of communities, not the weaknesses. (18 minutes). |

Asset-based community development identifies five types of assets in a community:

*   Individuals
*   Associations - groups of individuals
*   Institutions - formal and professional groups of people— government agencies, businesses, etc.
*   Physical resources - land, money, meeting space, computers, etc.
*   Connections - relationships between assets.

A successful asset-based effort—including community partnerships—is one that creates or strengthens relationships and connections created between these five assets. When looking for potential partners, look for the ways that the partnership will strengthen those connections.
