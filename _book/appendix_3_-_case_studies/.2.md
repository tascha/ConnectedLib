| Saint Paul Public Library System’s HOMAGO-based Createch labs are the result of partnerships with several local organizations. The library shares a facility with Saint Paul Parks and Recreation, and both were involved in the design of the space. The Science Museum of Minnesota and the Saint Paul Neighborhood Network bring programming and mentorship to the labs. The Science Museum of Minnesota found the dedicated, persistent teen spaces valuable, not only because they provided places to hold workshops, but also because the teens were already familiar and comfortable with the teen spaces.<sup><sup id="281255367986520-footnote-ref-46"><a href="#281255367986520-footnote-46">[47]</a></sup></sup> |

| To help address the needs of teens in [INTS_009]’s high-poverty area, the library hosts community organizations to make them more accessible to teens. “We work with other youth organizations who are serving youth… We have a mobile legal team who comes in on a monthly basis to provide free legal support to teens who need it. There are LGBTQ organizations for youth whose information we keep on display regularly. We have community partners from various areas kind of come in and do tabling. Because of the nature of our space, no one&#039;s giving presentations but they have access to the teens... We have access to youth, they need access to youth, and we provide them with that access and they provide our youth with resources. It&#039;s a beautiful relationship where everyone&#039;s benefiting. And just making sure that the relationship is always a two-way beneficial relationship is the key to [sustaining the relationship]. |

| Adult community members are a rich source of expertise for many libraries. Library staff we interviewed spoke highly of their many adult volunteers who work with teens. |

| Simple partnerships can lead to more extensive collaborations as the relationship develops. In a midwestern town surrounded by rural farmland, INTK_005 has developed a great relationship with a local game store. The owner donates merchandise to be used as trivia prizes and themed snacks for movie nights (“For our Naruto movie, everybody went home with either wasabi candy or ginger candy.”) He shares his expertise by running video game tournaments at the library and judging a game-making contest. In return, the store earns exposure and goodwill with the teens, and the library buys gift cards from the store as additional prizes. |

| **Partnership Type**: Bringing library programming to partner |

| In 2013, Denver Public Library launched a year-long project to improve their teen services with the help of a community asset mapping project. They identified many teen-related organizations in Denver and interviewed 40 of them, asking them about their work, the teens they serve, potential partnerships with the library, and any gaps they saw in services for teens in the community. They also interviewed library staff and held focus groups with teens. |

| Chicago Public Library’s YOUmedia program and the National Veterans Art Museum made their first connection through Hive Chicago. The museum hosted weekly art programs in the library’s teen space, which was more centrally located and had an established teen community. Museum staff modified their workshop programming to suit YOUmedia’s “drop-in” style. |

| The Las Vegas-Clark County Library runs a popular Learn to DJ program for teenagers. Partnerships with local government agencies and organizations like the Girl Scouts of Nevada provide teens with opportunities to showcase their skills before a public audience, and provide the organizations with entertainment for their events. |

| Partnerships can be a way to introduce new youth to the library when your partner brings their existing audiences to you. |

| The executive director of the Laotian Community Center wanted to capture the stories of the seniors in the Laotian community in Providence, Rhode Island, many of whom came to the United States as refugees. Brainstorming with Providence Public Library led to a project to teach teens how to create oral histories. Librarians at PPL were able to adapt an existing workshop to be suitable for the context and participants and conducted a day-long program at the community center with the help of a third partner: a graduate student from nearby Brown University. The program taught the teens history, interview techniques, and media skills, and led to additional collaborations between some of the partners. |

| Staff at Chicago Public Library worked closely with an outreach and education specialist at Adler Planetarium to develop extensive space-related programming for youth—including summer reading, field trips to the planetarium, and telescopes at the library. Planetarium staff trained CPL staff and teens to use telescopes and evaluated CPL branches to determine which were best situated for stargazing. The planetarium held “Scopes in the City” programs at several library branches. |
