<div class="table-format"><span class="title"><h5 id="providence-public-library--rhode-island-school-of-design">PROVIDENCE PUBLIC LIBRARY &amp; RHODE ISLAND SCHOOL OF DESIGN</h5></span>For a program about 1920&#x2019;s fashion, Providence Public Library partnered with the Rhode Island School of Design, a prestigious institution located only a few blocks away. An instructor from the school&#x2019;s Young Artist program provided teens with expert instruction, advice, and feedback while the teens created their own designs for 20s-inspired dresses. Connecting with a professional designer gave teens an experience that would not have been possible with the library&#x2019;s resources alone.</div>

AND THE MECKLENBURG COUNTY SHERIFF&#x2019;S OFFICE</h5></span>The Mecklenburg County Sheriff&apos;s Office had operated a successful library system in the two county jails for years, but administrators saw a need to increase programming for youthful offenders. The jail did not have the staff capacity to handle more specialized programming, so the jail library&apos;s director&#x2014;a former public librarian&#x2014;reached out to the Charlotte Mecklenburg Library. Administrators at the public library immediately saw the benefits of such a partnership to the jail (better programming for their youth), the library (the ability to reach an audience that was unable to visit the library), and the community (youth would be better prepared for life after release). <br>
Library staff were able to use existing youth programming modified slightly for the youth at the jail. For instance, they offered single-session versions of some classes, for youth who were about to be released, and they made connections to other youth programs that were available at the jail. <br>
The most needed programming involved technology literacy, which library staff combined with creativity and social skills to create impactful programs&#x2014;for example, they incorporate book reports into a podcasting class, and encouraged computer literacy and peer interactions through gaming tournaments. The items the youth created served as evidence of the program&apos;s impact.<ul><li>High Impact Partnership:Serving Youth Offenders.(2010). By Angela Craig.

The library shares a facility with Saint Paul Parks and Recreation, and both were involved in the design of the space. The Science Museum of Minnesota and the Saint Paul Neighborhood Network bring programming and mentorship to the labs. The Science Museum of Minnesota found the dedicated, persistent teen spaces valuable, not only because they provided places to hold workshops, but also because the teens were already familiar and comfortable with the teen spaces.<br>

<div class="table-format"><span class="title"><h5 id="youth-serving-organizations">YOUTH-SERVING ORGANIZATIONS</h5></span>To help address the needs of teens in [INTS_009]&#x2019;s high-poverty area, the library hosts community organizations to make them more accessible to teens. &#x201C;We work with other youth organizations who are serving youth&#x2026; We have a mobile legal team who comes in on a monthly basis to provide free legal support to teens who need it. There are LGBTQ organizations for youth whose information we keep on display regularly. We have community partners from various areas kind of come in and do tabling. Because of the nature of our space, no one&apos;s giving presentations but they have access to the teens... We have access to youth, they need access to youth, and we provide them with that access and they provide our youth with resources. It&apos;s a beautiful relationship where everyone&apos;s benefiting. And just making sure that the relationship is always a two-way beneficial relationship is the key to [sustaining the relationship].</div>

<p><br></p>
<div class="table-format"><span class="title"><h5 id="adult-volunteers">ADULT VOLUNTEERS</h5></span>Adult community members are a rich source of expertise for many libraries. Library staff we interviewed spoke highly of their many adult volunteers who work with teens. <br>
INTS_006 uses personal connections and relationships to recruit both adult and teen volunteers. &#x201C;I try my best to remember everybody&apos;s name&#x2026; I build this relationship with every single person that I come in contact with and the next thing you know, they lead me to another person, they lead me to another thing and then we just have so many different partnerships right now. It&apos;s awesome. And because we have so much good families, good sentiment where everybody&apos;s pitching in, we can do so much more.&#x201D;<br>
One of the biggest benefits to come from this relationship building is the expertise of a retired electrical engineer who was working with the local high school&#x2019;s computer club. &#x201C;Somebody mentioned to us that he&apos;d be interested in helping you with the Lego robotics because he likes anything techy and he likes to work with older kids.&quot; The librarian invited him to volunteer at the library as well, and he now runs weekly Lego robotics workshops when he&#x2019;s not enjoying retirement by traveling. The librarian helps by managing the teens. &#x201C;He kind of shies away from managing the kids and trying to keep their focus, but he does have the technical know how. So, between both of us, we&apos;re able to keep the kids somewhat engaged.&#x201D;
</div>

<p><br></p>
<div class="table-format"><span class="title"><h5 id="local-business">LOCAL BUSINESS</h5></span>Simple partnerships can lead to more extensive collaborations as the relationship develops. In a midwestern town surrounded by rural farmland, INTK_005 has developed a great relationship with a local game store. The owner donates merchandise to be used as trivia prizes and themed snacks for movie nights (&#x201C;For our Naruto movie, everybody went home with either wasabi candy or ginger candy.&#x201D;) He shares his expertise by running video game tournaments at the library and judging a game-making contest. In return, the store earns exposure and goodwill with the teens, and the library buys gift cards from the store as additional prizes.

<div class="table-format"><span class="title"><h5 id="case-study-denver-public-library">CASE STUDY: DENVER PUBLIC LIBRARY</h5></span><br>In 2013, Denver Public Library launched a year-long project to improve their teen services with the help of a community asset mapping project. They identified many teen-related organizations in Denver and interviewed 40 of them, asking them about their work, the teens they serve, potential partnerships with the library, and any gaps they saw in services for teens in the community. They also interviewed library staff and held focus groups with teens. 
<br>The interviews with the other youth-serving organizations revealed not just information about the organizations&#x2019; services, but also information about key issues facing Denver teens. The resulting report and its recommendations served as a guide as the library began forming partnerships and developing new programs for teens.

Brainstorming with Providence Public Library led to a project to teach teens how to create oral histories. Librarians at PPL were able to adapt an existing workshop to be suitable for the context and participants and conducted a day-long program at the community center with the help of a third partner: a graduate student from nearby Brown University. The program taught the teens history, interview techniques, and media skills, and led to additional collaborations between some of the partners.
