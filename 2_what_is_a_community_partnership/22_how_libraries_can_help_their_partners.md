## 2.2 How Libraries Can Help Their Partners {#2-2-how-libraries-can-help-their-partners}

<div class="text">“I've been most recently working with the Boys &amp; Girls Club... to try and get more library programming over there for them and to help them sort of build their capacity for doing programming, either with me or without me.” - INTS_063</div>

<br>
The benefits of a partnership to the library are clear, but what about the benefit to the partnering organization or individual? Remember that a partnership supports the goals of both organizations, not just the library. When you approach a potential partner you should present the ways they will benefit as well as what the library and the youth stand to gain.

<table class="heading-cell"><tr><th>LIBRARIES CAN PROVIDE SPACE FOR PARTNERS</th><td>OAs community centers, most libraries can offer partners space to conduct their own programs and activities. Even if the partner has space of their own, the library might be more popular or accessible.</td>
</tr><tr><th>LIBRARIES CAN PROVIDE A NEW AUDIENCE FOR PARTNERS</th><td>A library with a thriving teen population can provide a ready-made audience for the partners’ activities. They can also help bridge the “trust gap” that new youth-serving organizations may face when they try to offer new services to an audience that is not familiar with them.[7]</td></tr><tr><th>PARTNERS CAN BRING THE LIBRARY TO NEW AUDIENCES</th><td>Youth services librarians need to get out of the library building and go to teens “where they are, rather than waiting for teens to to find a way to get to the physical library space.”[6] Partners might have spaces that youth are already using where you can bring programs. Look back at the list in the previous section—these same organizations might have spaces where you can take your programming.<a href="#"><br><br>CASE STUDY: CHARLOTTE MECKLENBURG LIBRARY AND THE MECKLENBURG COUNTY SHERIFF’S OFFICE</a></td></tr><tr><th>A FULLER PERSPECTIVE ON THE COMMUNITY</th><td>Even if library staff do a great and thorough job of getting to know the teens that come into the library, understanding the teens who _don’t_ come into the library is a different story. Partners who work with different segments of the youth population can fill the library in on what they’re missing.<div class="text">Working with other community partners who know what's going on in the big picture can help actually bring in more teens to make it more global in terms of that community. -- INTK_002</div><a href="#"><br>CASE STUDY: DENVER PUBLIC LIBRARY</a></td></tr><tr><th>PARTNERS CAN PROVIDE MATERIAL SUPPORT</th><td>Simply donating money or materials in return for a public “thank you” from the library is an easy entry point to partnership for many organizations, particularly local businesses.<a href="#"><br><br>CASE STUDY: PARTNERING WITH LOCAL BUSINESSES</a></td></tr></table>




| **LIBRARIES CAN PROVIDE SPACE FOR PARTNERS** |  |
| --- | --- |
| **** | </a></sup></sup> |
| **LIBRARIES CAN PROVIDE RESOURCES FOR PARTNERS** | Library staff can help partners integrate library resources—equipment, software, physical collections, or library staff themselves—into their programs. [INST_060] told us they keep an eye out for opportunities to promote the library’s resources in activities held in the library: “[W]e might just offer, as part of their program, to talk about our library resources if it fits in.” |
| **LIBRARIES CAN DELIVER PROGRAMMING AND EXPERTISE TO PARTNERS** | Partners don’t always have to come to the library—libraries can bring their expertise to their partners’ spaces. This can be as simple as conducting an established program or workshop in a new location, or working with the partner to develop something brand new or tailored to the partner’s needs. Library staff have unique knowledge and skills that can be shared. Conducting programming on-site can also help partners learn to conduct more programming themselves. |
| **LIBRARIES CAN PROMOTE PARTNERS AND HELP WITH OUTREACH** | Any organization that partners with a library can benefit from increased visibility in the community, but the more the organization interacts with patrons the stronger the potential impact can be. Theater, dance, and arts organizations in particular can use workshops to spark community interest in their productions and exhibits and even recruit new members. Some libraries provide community groups with time and space to be available to teens, particularly organizations that provide services like mental health counseling or legal services. |
| **LIBRARIES CAN PROVIDE OR FACILITATE SERVICE OPPORTUNITIES** | Through teen volunteer programs, libraries can offer opportunities for organizations that require their teens to perform community service, such as high schools or Interact.<sup><sup id="281255367986520-footnote-ref-7"><a href="#281255367986520-footnote-7">[8]</a></sup></sup> Libraries can also connect youth to volunteer opportunities with other organizations, particularly teens who have learned skills through labs or workshops at the library. |
