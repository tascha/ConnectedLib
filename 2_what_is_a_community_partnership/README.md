A **community partnership** is a formal relationship between a library and a local organization or individual who have joined forces on a project, program, or initiative that supports the goals of both entities. Unlike partnerships with national organizations, a community partnership is unique to the library and its local area.

Partnerships are not formed by simple client and contractor relationships. Although a partnership may involve payment and contracts, it is a deeper collaboration. Partners work with the library to develop a unique offering.

### PARTNERSHIPS BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY, TOO {#partnerships-benefit-the-community-too}

The community also benefits when libraries join forces with other organizations.

*   The combined resources and knowledge of the library and its partners can provide services and programs with greater impact.
*   When different organizations work together, they can reduce duplication and focus more efficiently on serving a wider audience, providing more options, or addressing a greater variety of needs.
*   Working together can enhance outreach for each organization, letting more people know about what they offer.
