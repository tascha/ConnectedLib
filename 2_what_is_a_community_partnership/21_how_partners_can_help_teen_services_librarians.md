## 2.1 How Partners Can Help Teen Services Librarians {#2-1-how-partners-can-help-teen-services-librarians}

There are many ways that community partnerships can benefit libraries. Partners can broaden the opportunities available to youth and can even increase the youth audience of the library by bringing the library and its services to youth who might not have experienced them otherwise.

### Partners can expose teens to new careers, opportunities, and interests

One of the most powerful ways partners can help libraries is by letting teens experience a diverse range of careers, opportunities, and interests. A professional can share expertise and real-world insight beyond what even the most accomplished teen services librarian can provide. Partners can mentor youth or library staff, and can be resources for programming.

<div class="table-format case-study"><span class="title"><h5>Providence Public Library and the Rhode Island School of Design</h5></span>
For a program about 1920’s fashion, Providence Public Library partnered with the Rhode Island School of Design, a prestigious institution located only a few blocks away. An instructor from the school’s Young Artist program provided teens with expert instruction, advice, and feedback while the teens created their own designs for 20s-inspired dresses. Connecting with a professional designer gave teens an experience that would not have been possible with the library’s resources alone.</div>

### Partners can bring new audiences to the library
Partners who have already built a youth community can introduce them to the library and its resources. Organizations with established audiences might include: scouts or 4-H clubs, YMCA/YWCA, schools, school clubs (e.g. the robotics club or Lego Mindstorm club), other youth-serving organizations, and city facilities like rec centers.

<div class="table-format case-study"><span class="title"><h5>New Audiences at the Library</h5></span>
Partnerships can be a way to introduce new youth to the library when your partner brings their existing audiences to you.</p><ul><li>A suburban library in the midwest holds STEAM programming for the local Boy Scout troop, bringing all the scouts in the library, along with some parents and siblings. </li><li>Another library's partnership with a high school e-sports club often brings new teens into the library.</li><li>Many libraries partner with Parks and Recreation departments--sometimes even sharing facilities--to bring the Parks and Rec visitors into the library.</li></ul></div>

### Partners can bring the library to new audiences

Youth services librarians need to get out of the library building and go to teens “where they are, rather than waiting for teens to to find a way to get to the physical library space.”[^2] Partners might have spaces that youth are already using where you can bring programs. Look back at the list in the previous section—these same organizations might have spaces where you can take your programming.

<div class="table-format case-study"><span class="title"><h5>Programs for Youthful Offenders</h5></span>
The Mecklenburg County Sheriff's Office had operated a successful library system in the two county jails for years, but administrators saw a need to increase programming for youthful offenders. The jail did not have the staff capacity to handle more specialized programming, so the jail library's director—a former public librarian—reached out to the Charlotte Mecklenburg Library. Administrators at the public library immediately saw the benefits of such a partnership to the jail (better programming for their youth), the library (the ability to reach an audience that was unable to visit the library), and the community (youth would be better prepared for life after release). Library staff were able to use existing youth programming modified slightly for the youth at the jail. For instance, they offered single-session versions of some classes, for youth who were about to be released, and they made connections to other youth programs that were available at the jail.

### A fuller perspective on the community
Even if library staff do a great and thorough job of getting to know the teens that come into the library, understanding the teens who _don’t_ come into the library is a different story. Partners who work with different segments of the youth population can fill the library in on what they’re missing.

<div class="table-format case-study"><span class="title"><h5>Community Mapping in Denver<?h5></span>
In 2013, Denver Public Library launched a year-long project to improve their teen services with the help of a community asset mapping project. They identified many teen-related organizations in Denver and interviewed 40 of them, asking them about their work, the teens they serve, potential partnerships with the library, and any gaps they saw in services for teens in the community. They also interviewed library staff and held focus groups with teens. <br/><br/>The interviews with the other youth-serving organizations revealed not just information about the organizations’ services, but also information about key issues facing Denver teens. The resulting report and its recommendations served as a guide as the library began forming partnerships and developing new programs for teens. <ul><li><a href="http://www.ala.org/pla/sites/ala.org.pla/files/content/about/fellows/TAMFinalReport.pdf"><b>Teen Asset Mapping Report: A Report and Recommendations From the Denver Public Library</b></a>.

### Partners can provide material support
Simply donating money or materials in return for a public “thank you” from the library is an easy entry point to partnership for many organizations, particularly local businesses.

<div class="table-format case-study"><span class="title"><h5>Partnering with Local Businesses</h5></span>
Simple partnerships can lead to more extensive collaborations as the relationship develops. In a midwestern town surrounded by rural farmland, a librarian has developed a great relationship with a local game store. The owner donates merchandise to be used as trivia prizes and themed snacks for movie nights (<b><i>“For our Naruto movie, everybody went home with either wasabi candy or ginger candy.”</i></b>) He shares his expertise by running video game tournaments at the library and judging a game-making contest. In return, the store earns exposure and goodwill with the teens, and the library buys gift cards from the store as additional prizes.</div>
