# 3.0 Types of Partners {#3-0-types-of-partners}
<hr/>
Although each partnership will be unique and require tailored approaches, the basic process involves identifying potential partners, establishing a partnership by “pitching” the idea and determining an appropriate collaboration, and (hopefully) working together successfully in a way that motivates both of you to maintain the partnership. The rest of this module will guide you through these steps.

<b>After completing Section 3: Types of Partners, you will be able to:</b><ul><li>Understand the opportunities and challenges involved in working with four different types of partners</li></ul></div>

In this section, we will look more closely at four common types of partners: 

1. Informal learning institutions 
2. Individuals, local businesses, and community groups
3. Youth-serving organizations
4. Schools

You may find some overlap between these categories (for instance, a community group may be formed around serving homeless youth).
