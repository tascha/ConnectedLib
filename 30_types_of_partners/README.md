# 3.0 Types of Partners {#3-0-types-of-partners}
<hr>

Although each partnership will be unique and require tailored approaches, the basic process involves identifying potential partners, establishing a partnership by “pitching” the idea and determining an appropriate collaboration, and (hopefully) working together successfully in a way that motivates both of you to maintain the partnership. The rest of this module will guide you through these steps.

In this section, we will look more closely at four common types of partners: (1) informal learning institutions; (2) individuals, local businesses, and community groups; (3) youth-serving organizations; and (4) schools. You may find some overlap between these categories (for instance, a community group may be formed around serving homeless youth).
