## 3.3 Youth-Serving Organizations {#3-3-youth-serving-organizations}

> "We&#039;ve partnered with a nonprofit organization... and they&#039;re local and their focus is to get everyone coding… We&#039;re both really excited. He loves libraries, and wanted to get technology and his organization doesn&#039;t really have a building. They just teach, but they don&#039;t have a site. So libraries are always good for space. So we were able to come together for a Computer Science Education Week."<br/> -- Urban Northeastern Library

There are a wide variety of youth-serving organizations other than the informal learning institutions we’ve already discussed. Organizations like the Boys and Girls Club of America, the Boy Scouts of America, the Girl Scouts, 4-H, and YMCA and YWCA are well known, but there may be many smaller groups in your community who have programs focused on youth. Government entities may also fall under this category—for instance, many employment services departments have programs for youth.

<table class="heading-cell6 no-common-style"><tr><th colspan="2">OPPORTUNITIES</th></tr><tr class="row1"><th>YOUR PARTNER’S EVENTS AND ACTIVITIES</th><td>Many organizations have regularly scheduled activities with the same group of youth. You may be able to integrate library programming into an existing meeting agenda, either as a one-time event or on a continuing basis.</td></tr><tr class="row2"><th>YOUR EVENTS AND ACTIVITIES</th><td>A regular newsletter or email with information about upcoming programs can be a good way to maintain relationships with youth-serving partners when you’re not actively working together. A library worker at an urban western library also includes information about any scholarships, job or volunteer opportunities, or contests relevant to youth, reinforcing the library’s position as a valuable community resource.</td></tr></table>

<table class="heading-cell6 no-common-style"><tr><th colspan="2">CHALLENGES</th></tr><tr class="row1"><th>UNFAMILIAR AUDIENCES</th><td>If the organization is bringing a new set of patrons into your library, make sure your staff are prepared and equipped to serve them appropriately. This is particularly important if the teens have special abilities or needs, or are in a vulnerable situation. Professional development and training can help staff gain the skills and understanding they need to serve an unfamiliar group of patrons.</td></tr><tr class="row2"><th>VULNERABLE TEENS</th><td>Organizations that work with vulnerable teens may have policies in place to protect them and their privacy, and you may need to adjust your programs or procedures accordingly. Discuss this with your partner during the planning stage so you won’t be surprised by a policy mid-project.</td></tr><tr class="row3"><th>TURNOVER</th><td>Organizations that work with teens in particularly difficult situations may have a turnover rate that is higher than normal. To avoid “starting over” with each new employee, try to get more than one person at the other organization invested and involved in your partnership.
