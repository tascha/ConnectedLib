| The [Mecklenburg County Sheriff&#039;s Office](http://www.mecksheriff.com) had operated a successful library system in the two county jails for years, but administrators saw a need to increase programming for youthful offenders. The jail did not have the staff capacity to handle more specialized programming, so the jail library&#039;s director—a former public librarian—reached out to the [Charlotte Mecklenburg Library](https://www.cmlibrary.org). Administrators at the public library immediately saw the benefits of such a partnership to the jail (better programming for their youth), the library (the ability to reach an audience that was unable to visit the library), and the community (youth would be better prepared for life after release). |
