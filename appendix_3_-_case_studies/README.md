[PPL RISD](#pplRISD)


<hr/>
### Providence Public Library {#ppl}
|Fashion Forward|
|---|
|For a program about 1920’s fashion, Providence Public Library partnered with the Rhode Island School of Design, a prestigious institution located only a few blocks away. An instructor from the school’s Young Artist program provided teens with expert instruction, advice, and feedback while the teens created their own designs for 20s-inspired dresses. Connecting with a professional designer gave teens an experience that would not have been possible with the library’s resources alone.|

|Learning About History with the Laotian Community Center|
|---|
|The executive director of the Laotian Community Center wanted to capture the stories of the seniors in the Laotian community in Providence, Rhode Island, many of whom came to the United States as refugees. Brainstorming with Providence Public Library led to a project to teach teens how to create oral histories. Librarians at PPL were able to adapt an existing workshop to be suitable for the context and participants and conducted a day-long program at the community center with the help of a third partner: a graduate student from nearby Brown University. The program taught the teens history, interview techniques, and media skills, and led to additional collaborations between some of the partners.|






### St. Paul Public Library
|CREATECH|
|---|
|The Saint Paul Public Library System’s HOMAGO-based [Createch labs](http://www.sppl.org/teens/createch) are the result of partnerships with several local organizations. The library shares a facility with Saint Paul Parks and Recreation, and both were involved in the design of the space. The [Science Museum of Minnesota](https://www.smm.org) and the Saint Paul Neighborhood Network bring programming and mentorship to the labs. The Science Museum of Minnesota found the dedicated, persistent teen spaces valuable, not only because they provided places to hold workshops, but also because the teens were already familiar and comfortable with the teen spaces.|

## A Suburban Northeast Library {#INTS009}
| Partnering with Youth-Serving Organizations |
|---|
| To help address the needs of teens in a high-poverty area, the library hosts community organizations to make them more accessible to teens. **_“We work with other youth organizations who are serving youth… We have a mobile legal team who comes in on a monthly basis to provide free legal support to teens who need it. There are LGBTQ organizations for youth whose information we keep on display regularly. We have community partners from various areas kind of come in and do tabling. Because of the nature of our space, no one's giving presentations but they have access to the teens... We have access to youth, they need access to youth, and we provide them with that access and they provide our youth with resources. It's a beautiful relationship where everyone's benefiting. And just making sure that the relationship is always a two-way beneficial relationship is the key to [sustaining the relationship]._** |

## A Rural Western Library {#INTS006}
|Adult Volunteers|
|---|
|Adult community members are a rich source of expertise for many libraries. Library staff we interviewed spoke highly of their many adult volunteers who work with teens. They use personal connections and relationships to recruit both adult and teen volunteers. **_“I try my best to remember everybody's name… I build this relationship with every single person that I come in contact with and the next thing you know, they lead me to another person, they lead me to another thing and then we just have so many different partnerships right now. It's awesome. And because we have so much good families, good sentiment where everybody's pitching in, we can do so much more.”_**<p/><p/>One of the biggest benefits to come from this relationship building is the expertise of a retired electrical engineer who was working with the local high school’s computer club. _**“Somebody mentioned to us that he'd be interested in helping you with the Lego robotics because he likes anything techy and he likes to work with older kids."**_ The librarian invited him to volunteer at the library as well, and he now runs weekly Lego robotics workshops when he’s not enjoying retirement by traveling. The librarian helps by managing the teens. **_“He kind of shies away from managing the kids and trying to keep their focus, but he does have the technical know how. So, between both of us, we're able to keep the kids somewhat engaged.”_**|

## Las Vegas-Clark County Library {#lvcc}

|The Learn to DJ Lab|
|---|
|The Las Vegas-Clark County Library runs a popular Learn to DJ program for teenagers.

## YOUMedia Chicago (Chicago Public Library) {#youmedia}
|The National Veterans Art Museum|
|---|
|Chicago Public Library’s YOUmedia program and the <a href="http://www.nvam.org">National Veterans Art Museum</a> made their first connection through Hive Chicago. The museum hosted weekly art programs in the library’s teen space, which was more centrally located and had an established teen community. Museum staff modified their workshop programming to suit YOUmedia’s “drop-in” style.|

|Adler Planetarium|
|---|
|Staff at Chicago Public Library worked closely with an outreach and education specialist at Adler Planetarium to develop extensive space-related programming for youth—including summer reading, field trips to the planetarium, and telescopes at the library. Planetarium staff trained CPL staff and teens to use telescopes and evaluated CPL branches to determine which were best situated for stargazing. The planetarium held “Scopes in the City” programs at several library branches.|
