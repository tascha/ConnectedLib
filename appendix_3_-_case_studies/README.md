<div class="table-format"><span class="title"><h5>PROVIDENCE PUBLIC LIBRARY & RHODE ISLAND SCHOOL OF DESIGN</h5></span>For a program about 1920’s fashion, Providence Public Library partnered with the Rhode Island School of Design, a prestigious institution located only a few blocks away. An instructor from the school’s Young Artist program provided teens with expert instruction, advice, and feedback while the teens created their own designs for 20s-inspired dresses. Connecting with a professional designer gave teens an experience that would not have been possible with the library’s resources alone.</div>
