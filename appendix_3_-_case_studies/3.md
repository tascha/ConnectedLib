### “PARTNERSHIPS” OR “COLLABORATIONS”? {#partnerships-or-collaborations}

The difference between a collaboration and a partnership is largely a matter of scale, and what a large urban library might consider a small collaboration could be a significant partnership for a small rural library. Since _ConnectedLib_ is for libraries of all sizes and resources, we will use the terms somewhat interchangeably, generally using **partnership** to focus on the relationship, and **collaboration** to focus on the work done together.

*   REFLECT: Activity 3.A - Assets in your communityUse the [worksheet in Appendix 1](activity_3a_-_assets_in_your_community.md) to begin thinking about your community’s strengths. As you think of the individuals, associations, and institutions in your community, also be mindful of the relationships they have with the library (or with library staff) and with each other, and what physical resources they can bring to the table or the library can share with them. Note that you can group some assets together—for instance, you could include “parents” under the “individuals” heading, instead of listing individual parents.
*   **SHARE: Activity 3.B - Your library’s assets**Think of the five types of assets—individuals, associations, institutions, physical resources, and connections. What assets does your library have in each of the five categories? What do they bring to the table? Post your answer in the discussion forums.
*   **ASSESS: Activity 3.C - Quiz or something**Have Milly do this.
